## Abstract of Article
We consider a practical cell-free massive multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) system with multiantenna access points (APs) and spatially correlated Rician fading channels. 
The significant phase-shift of the line-of-sight component induced by the user equipment movement is modeled randomly. 
Furthermore, we investigate the uplink spectral efficiency (SE) with maximum ratio (MR)/local minimum mean squared error (L-MMSE) combining and optimal large-scale fading decoding based on the phase-aware MMSE, phase-aware element-wise MMSE and linear MMSE (LMMSE) estimators. 
Then new closed-form SE expressions with MR combining are derived. Numerical results validate our derived expressions and show that the SE benefits from the spatial correlation. 
It is important to observe that the performance gap between L-MMSE and MR combining increases with the number of antennas per AP and the SE of the LMMSE estimator is lower than that of other estimators due to the lack of phase-shifts knowledge.
